General grammar and style:
* Australian English
* spaced en dashes for general uses, em dashes for cut-off dialogue and special uses such as quote attributions
* singulars ending in s given possessive with 's, unless that singular noun is a plural word, e.g. Chris's guitar, but the Beatles' first album
* no Oxford/serial comma – instead, follow good style rules and use as few commas as necessary to clearly convey information
* do not write "should/could/would of", unless conveying a character of poor education or with very colloquial speech
* do not write "[adjective] of a/an [noun]", e.g. "that big of a deal", unless conveying a character of poor education or with very colloquial speech
* quotation marks should only contain the punctuation which belongs to the quote (see examples in previous notes)
* write numbers as full words unless it seems more practical not to (e.g. something like "They fired 1337 missiles at us!")
* no comma splices unless very short and usually matching phrases like "I came, I saw, I conquered" – dashes almost always suffice
* comma not required before "too" unless it's an adverb: "You can come too!", but "And I was so close, too!"
* checkout, backup, setup, etc.: nouns
* check out, back up, set up, etc.: verbs

Fansubbing - script
* trailing ellipsis not necessary for a line which will be completed later, unless there is a significant pause/interruption and/or the sentence trails off
* no leading ellipsis unless the start of the sentence was never actually spoken, in which case it should be spaced and begin without a capital letter
* three-liners bad (obviously)
* manual line-breaks preferred even if it already breaks where you want it to in case of renderer differences – the \q2 tag should also be used with any linebreak to prevent accidental three-liners due to renderer differences
* stutters/stammers: use a hyphen, repeat the first sound (not necessarily just the first letter) and duplicate capitalisation, e.g. "Wh-What?"
* if more than one repetition, no need to match exactly – two can usually suffice, e.g. だ だ だ 大丈夫！ can be "W-W-We'll be fine!"
* for I and a, space it out and use en dashes (I hate "stuttering" whole words)
* this has never come up, but do not follow standard procedure for the word X-ray, as "X-X-ray?" would look stupid as heck (this can also be understood to apply to other words which would look terrible)

Fansubbing - timing (note: rules are made to be broken when necessary, especially with stuff like high CPS short or overlapping lines near a shot change, but these are a starting point and usually applicable)
* leadin: 120ms
* leadout: 350ms
* join end to start of next line or subsequent shot change: 425ms
* join start to preceding shot change: 150ms
* if the start of a line is around 280–360ms after a shot change, shorten leadin to 80ms or even 40ms: leadin that long is distracting, but short gaps are almost as bad
* alpha timing is (usually) very bad

Fansubbing - song timing (note: this is inherently more creative and flexible, but this is a starting point and usually applicable to simple styling)
* leadin: 260ms (allowing for 125ms of fade)
* leadout: 500ms (allowing for 200ms of fade)
* snapping: about the leadin/out amount minus fade allowance, but follow your heart
I haven't really played with this, but slower songs could probably have longer fades and more energetic ones shorter
