General grammar and style:
* Australian English
* spaced en-dashes (not em-dashes, excepting special uses such as quote attributions)
* singulars ending in s given possessive with 's, unless that singular noun is a plural word, e.g. Chris's guitar, but the Beatles' first album
* no Oxford/serial comma – instead, follow good style rules and use as few commas as necessary to clearly convey information
* do not write "should/could/would of", unless conveying a character of poor education or with very colloquial speech
* do not write "[adjective] of a/an [noun]", e.g. "that big of a deal", unless conveying a character of poor education or with very colloquial speech
* quotation marks should only contain the punctuation which belongs to the quote (see examples in previous notes)
* write numbers as full words unless it seems more practical not to
* checkout, backup, setup, etc.: nouns
* check out, back up, set up, etc.: verbs

Fansubbing
* trailing ellipsis not necessary for a line which will be completed later, unless there is a significant pause
* no leading ellipsis unless the start of the sentence was never actually spoken, in which case it should be spaced and begin without a capital letter
* three-liners bad
* manual line-breaks preferred even if it breaks where you want it to in case of renderer differences – the \q2 tag should also be used with any linebreak to prevent accidental three-liners due to renderer discrepancies
